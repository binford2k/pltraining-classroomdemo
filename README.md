# pltraining-classroomdemo

This module just contains a collection of demos for our trainers to use in the
classroom. It's likely nothing your interested in, unless you're a Puppet Labs
or partner trainer.

That being said, you're welcome to poke through it.

The modules used by these classes are not set as dependencies, so they will not
be installed automatically by `puppet module install`. If you want to use them,
you'll want to install them separately:

* Requirements for `classroomdemo::aws`:
  * `puppetlabs/aws`
